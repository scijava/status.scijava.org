This repository contains code to update the
[SciJava component status table](https://status.scijava.org/).

SciJava maintainers use this table to see at a glance which components of the
[SciJava component collection](https://imagej.net/develop/architecture#definitions):

1. Have a newer release version than the one managed by the
   [SciJava Bill of Materials](https://imagej.net/develop/architecture#bill-of-materials);
2. Contain changes on the master branch which have not yet been released;
3. Have broken CI builds.
